Hello and welcome to the ASCII Keyboard!

This is a fun project I am working on that came to my mind in the middle of a programming lab at university.

The idea is to create a simple Keyboard where the only buttons will be a 1 and a 0 (and later on added a clear button). With these two
buttons, one can enter the ASCII values of characters and commands like Backspace which will then be registered by a computer.
I was tinkering with the MSP430s and though this would be an entertaining project and one where I can learn about how USB devices work
and the sort catagories they fall in, like my HID device.

Using the code, Code Composser Studio (to program the device), and schematic in the Hardware folder, one can create their own ASCII Keyboard!
